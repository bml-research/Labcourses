## Experiment 7: Use and effect of a hot inoculation loop

Day 2  
- Take a very hot inoculation loop and touch the colony on a plate and graft onto a new NA plate by streaking the inoculation loop over the culture medium  
- Do the same on another plate with a flamed and well-cooled inoculation loop.
