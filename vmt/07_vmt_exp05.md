## Experiment 5: Air Sedimentation 

To prevent infection from the air, always work within 15 cm of a brightly burning flame so that the air is forced upwards. The number of germs in the air in a work area highly depends on the activity in that area, the type of work being undertaken there and the types of people present. For an idea of the composition and ‘number’ of micro-organisms in the air, they can be sedimented on open YAG (Yeast Agar Glucose) and MA (Malt Agar) plates.  

### Preparatory questions:  
1. Which type of micro-organism grows primarily on MA plates?  
2. Which type of micro-organism grows primarily on YAG plates?  
3. In what two ways can you prevent sedimentation of unwanted micro-organisms from the air in your experiment?  

### Execution:  
- Take four YAG and four MA plates (will be ready for you). Place them in an open area of the room for analysis. The petri dishes must be open for 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes. This should be done by closing them after 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes respectively.
- Incubate them for two days at 37°C.  
- Count the number of colonies per culture medium.  
- In addition, describe a number of characteristic colonies.  

>Assignment:   
Describe your results using a table.  
On a graph, plot the number of colonies per type of plate against the sedimentation time.
