## Experiment 2: Influence of washing and disinfection on skin flora

Once you have finished your experiment or leave the SMT area for another reason, you must wash your hands. For an understanding of the presence of bacteria on your hands and to remove them in the most effective way possible, proceed as follows:  

### Execution
-	Take a blood plate and divide it into six sections on the bottom using a felt-tip pen. On the culture medium, press carefully with the left index finger into compartment 1.  

-	Then, wash your hands quickly with water and regular soap, rinse well with plenty of running water, allow your hands to air dry and press into compartment 2.  

-	Then, brush the finger vigorously for two minutes with plenty of water and soap, rinse well with water and allow to air dry. Press the finger into compartment 3.  

-	Now, hold the finger in a container of betadine soap for 30 seconds. After quickly rinsing the betadine soap off with running water, air dry the finger and press it into compartment 4.  

-	Compartment 5: press the finger into compartment 5 30 minutes after pressing it in to compartment 4. You can continue working as usual during these 30 minutes.  

-	Compartment 6: make an impression with another finger by following the same method as for compartment 2, but this time use a disinfectant soap. Note that the disinfectant soap, which is ethanol-based, should be used without any water and instead be rubbed dry onto the hands/fingers.  

Incubate overnight at a temperature of 37Â°C.  

### Preparatory questions
1.	Consult the literature for the difference between transient and resident skin flora.  
2.	When plating the skin flora on blood agar, there will, in some cases, be colonies that exhibit alpha, beta or gamma haemolysis. How does this look on a blood agar plate and what causes this appearance?  
3.	Under the guidelines (guide page 20: handboekggoHanze_student.pdf on Bb), how should you treat your hands if they have become contaminated while working?  


Create a gram stain of the colony that you will use for experiment-9 (see experiment-10 for the gram staining; see experiment-9 for further instructions).  


>Assignment:  
Document your results using photographs and a table. In the table, describe the numbers of colonies, the colour and the form. Take a photograph or draw a picture of the bacteria after gram staining. Specify your conclusion at the end.
