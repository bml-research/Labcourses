## Experiment 4: Contamination through condensation

Condensation can be heavily contaminated thus making it a source of contamination. This experiment demonstrates that the culture media must be dried before they are used. In addition, when a petri dish is opened, the jumping of liquid film between the cap and bottom can lead to aerosol formation.  

#### Preparatory questions:  
1. What appearance do E. coli colonies have on a MacConkey culture medium?  
2. Who is responsible for properly disinfecting the workbenches once work with GMOs is complete (see guide: handboekggoHanze_student.pdf Appendix 2, on Bb)?  

#### Execution
- Inoculate one of the freshly poured nutrient agar plates after coagulation with 0.1 ml of an *E. coli* culture.  
- Spread this culture out with a Drigalski spatula.    
- Incubate for no less than one hour at 37°C (with the cap upwards = incorrect).  
- Wear gloves and disinfect with 70% ethanol. Then, turn the plate upside down twice.  
- Open the petri dish with the gloved hand and, using a sterile cotton swap moistened in sterile $H_2O$, remove some of the condensation from the caps of the petri dish and transfer it to a MacConkey agar plate.  
- Rub the fingers of the gloved hand over a second MacConkey plate.  
- Incubate both plates at 37°C.
