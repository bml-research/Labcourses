## SMT programme

### Day 1: (Start) 

1.SMT film entitled ‘Exactly as it should be’.  
2.Discussion about film and SMT programme.  

#### Start:  
3.SMT-1: Disinfection of surfaces  
4.SMT-2: Influence of washing and disinfection on skin flora  
5.SMT-3: Determination of a number of cultivable micro-organisms (dilution series, medium preparation, pour plates)  
6.SMT-4: Condensation contamination  
7.SMT-5: Air sedimentation. TIP: Use first!  
8.SMT-7 Use and effect of hot inoculation loops  
9.SMT-8 Streaking  

### Day 2: (Continuation)

#### Completion:
1.Assessment of SMT-1: no/little/lots of growth? Which disinfectant is best (compared to the control)?  
2.Assessment of SMT-2: count and describe the colonies – are the results in line with the expectations?   
3.Assessment of SMT-4: condensation contamination.  

#### Start:
4.SMT-6: Incorrect flaming with quantity of solid culture  
5.SMT-9: Sensitivity test  

#### Continuation:  
6.SMT-7: Use and effect of hot inoculation loops  
7.SMT-8 Assess streaking and continue pure cultivation  

(Gram staining: at own discretion)  

### Day 3: (Results)

#### Completion:
1.SMT-3: Count mix and spread plates with between 30 and 300 micro-organisms.  
How many micro-organisms did the original product contain?  
2.SMT-5: Assessment of air sedimentation. Count and describe the colonies.  
3.SMT-6: incorrect flaming with quantity of solid culture.  
4.SMT-7 Use and effect of hot inoculation loops.  
5.SMT-8 Assessment of streaking.  
6.SMT-9: Assessment of sensitivity test.  
7.SMT debrief.  
8.Complete SMT test.  
9.Clean up all cultures and materials  
10.Complete logbook  

Gram staining of: total of min. four different colonies  

Collect all plastic waste in autoclave bags and ask the lecturer for assistance with autoclaving. All glassware that has been in contact with micro-organisms must also be autoclaved. No glassware should be placed in the bags. Glassware should be placed in the glass container once any micro-organisms present have been inactivated.
