# Safe Microbiological Techniques (SMT)

## 1.1. Theory 

### 1.1.1. An introduction to SMT
Sterile working (or aseptic working) is the name given to procedures used when working with cell cultures/micro-organisms. It often refers to the techniques used for all cell cultures. In this course, you will learn the basic techniques needed when working with micro-organisms. The concept of Safe Microbiological Techniques has two main objectives:

- To prevent contamination of cultures in the laboratory by external sources, e.g. the skin, clothing or the environment (air).
- To prevent microbial contamination of laboratory personnel (in this case, this includes students) and the environment.

>All microbial cultures must be classified as contaminated material. If work is being carried out with cell cultures, SMT must be applied at all times.

Caution is required is because:
- There is always the possibility of unknowingly isolating a hazardous, pathogenic bacterium from a relatively harmless cell culture or sample.
- Some individuals are much more susceptible to certain micro-organisms than others and not everyone who is exposed to a particular micro-organism will become ill.
- Laboratory cultures often contain large quantities of micro-organisms. Such large quantities are often much more hazardous than smaller quantities. 
- Micro-organisms sometimes undergo spontaneous mutations, giving them different properties.


The most common risk when working with micro-organisms is the risk of penetration via the skin. It is essential that all cuts and wounds are covered with a plaster or that gloves are worn.

### 1.1.2. SMT work area
When SMT is applied, the layout and work area of the laboratory must satisfy ML-II requirements. When working to these requirements, the following layout and work instructions are important. 

Layout instructions:
**Area**

a. The work area must comprise a permanent structure where the work surfaces, floors, walls and doors are finished with a non-absorbent material and where the work surfaces are resistant to water, acids, bases, solvents, disinfectants and disinfectant reagents, and are easy to clean;  

b. The work area must be accessed through a lockable door:
- With an indication that the area is an ML-II area;
- With the biohazard symbol;  
- With the names and telephone numbers of at least one person responsible for the area and the name and telephone number of the biological safety officer;  

c. It must not be possible to open windows in the work area.

Equipment
d. An autoclave must be available in the building;
e. A wash basin and soap dispenser must be located close to the exits to the work area, where both the tap and the dispenser can be operated without having to use the hands; 
f. There must be a coat stand in the work area for work clothing;
g. There must be a safety cabinet of class-II in the work area.

Miscellaneous
h. Equipment must be in good condition.

**Work instructions:**
General
a. The work area must be kept clean and tidy;
b. Eating, drinking, smoking, the presence of eating and drinking utensils, applying cosmetics and storing food and drink in the work area must be prohibited;
c. Pipetting by mouth must prohibited;
d. The presence of vermin must be excluded;
e. Access to the work area must be locked if no personnel are in the work area;
f. Access to the work area must be prohibited to unauthorised personnel; 
g. Work clothing must be disinfected or sterilised before it is washed;
h. Personal possessions, including clothing that is not being worn, must be stored outside of the work area;
i. Following written approval from the biological safety officer, the work area may be used for solely ML-I activities in accordance with the instructions specified under 4.1.1.1 or solely for activities involving non-genetically-modified organisms. This must be indicated on the access door. Employees concerned must be informed of this in advance;
j. Following contamination, contaminated surfaces must be disinfected immediately.

During work
k. The doors to the work area must be closed whilst work is being carried out;
l. Work that may produce aerosols must be carried out in a safety cabinet of class II; 
m. Wrist watches and jewellery on the hands and arms must be prohibited;
n. Appropriate protective clothing must be worn. This clothing must be left behind in the work area once work is complete.
