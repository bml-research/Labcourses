## Experiment 6: Incorrect flaming of the inoculation loop (splash test)

Incorrect annealing of an inoculation loop can lead to contamination of the environment. In this experiment, the inoculation loop is deliberately flamed incorrectly.  

### Execution
Day 1  
To flame an inoculation loop correctly, you should proceed as follows:  
1. Hold the eyelet in the ‘cold’ part of the flame so that contaminated material in the eyelet is firstly evaporated through thermal conduction.
2. After evaporation, the material is incinerated by heating the eyelet in the hottest part of the flame until it is glowing hot.
3. The entire wire should then be heated until glowing hot.
4. The metal part of the inoculation loop holder is then run through the flame three times more (avoid overheating).  

[This movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbNkJ6UKNXY) shows the correct way to sterilise the inoculation loop.  


Day 2  
- Place the burner in the centre of a sheet of A2 filter paper. Place a maximum of two MacConkey plates per person close to the flame. If there are several people, you can use several MacConkey plates at various distances apart. Take a photograph of the setup and record which plate is where.  
- Take an inoculation loop of bacterial colony material from your incubated plate of E. coli culture and open the prepared petri dishes.
- Flame the eyelet directly over a maximum burning flame.  
- Splashing can be repeated several times  
- Incubate the plates overnight at a temperature of 37°C  

>Assignment:  
Count the number of *E. coli* colonies that you encounter on the various culture media. Describe your findings in your logbook. Specify your conclusion at the end.
