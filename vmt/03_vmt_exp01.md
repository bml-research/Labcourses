## Experiment 1: Disinfection of surfaces  

Every practical session must start and end with disinfection of the bench surface using 70% ethanol Would it not be better to use Amochlor or green soap?  
The disinfectant effect of different disinfectant solutions is compared.  

### Execution
Disinfect three tiles thoroughly with 70% ethanol. Once the ethanol has evaporated, apply 0.1 ml of E. coli culture to the tiles using a Pasteur pipette.  
Then, apply 0.5 ml of Amochlor to one tile using a Gilson pipette and 0.5 ml of green soap to the second tile followed by an excess of ethanol to the third tile. The suspensions must be applied to the tiles separately from one another. The liquids are then mixed on the tiles with three sterile cotton applicators. Mix and apply tile by tile, otherwise there won’t be enough time.  

Solutions to be tested:	 
1. Amochlor 
2. Green soap (diluted 1:100)
3. Ethanol 70%

- Moisten a sterile cotton applicator with nutrient both (= liquid medium) and press out any abundant liquid.  
- Using the moistened sterile cotton applicator, take a sample as quickly as possible at 0 min. (= t0 immediately after mixing disinfectant and E. coli), after 2 min. (= t1), after 8 min. (= t2) and after 16 min. (= t3).  
- Transfer the cotton applicator to a culture tube with nutrient both.  
- Inoculate a tube with a cotton applicator moistened with nutrient broth that has not been in contact with the culture (= sterility control)  
- Inoculate a tube with a cotton applicator with E. coli cells from the culture (= growth control).  
- Inoculate overnight at a temperature of 37°C and assess for growth.  


### Preparatory questions

1. What is the benefit of the two controls?  
2. How many tubes of nutrient both are required for this experiment (practical preparation)?  
3. If there is a spillage in a GMO (genetically-modified organism) area, which disinfectant can be used to disinfect the bench (search in this guide:  handboekggoHanze_student.pdf on Bb)?  



>Assignment:  
Create a table with the results achieved. Specify your conclusion at the end.
