# Pipetting fluids

## Learning outcomes
- Pipetting fluids


## Introduction
During this training you will need to transfer liquids from one place to another. In most cases, when it comes to small volumes, a pipette is used for this. A pipette is a laboratory tool commonly used in chemistry, biology and medicine to transport a measured volume of liquid. Pipettes come in several designs for various purposes with differing levels of accuracy and precision. Many pipette types work by creating a partial vacuum above the liquid-holding chamber and selectively releasing this vacuum to draw up and dispense liquid. Measurement accuracy varies greatly depending on the instrument. It is important to use the pipette correctly so that you transfer liquids with a high degree of accuracy.
There are many different types of pipettes that are used in practice:
1. Adjustable pipettes, from left: 20–200 μl, 2–20 μl, 100–1000 μl; 
2. Graded transfer pipette and electric pipette filler; 
3. 25 mL, 10 mL, 5 mL, and 2 mL transfer pipettes; 
4. Disposable tips for adjustable pipettes; 
5. 12-channel adjustable pipette for microplates; 
6. Low-retention 0.5–10 μl adjustable pipette; 
7. Squeezable transfer pipettes; 
8. Digital adjustable pipette; 
9. Light-guided pipetting system
This manual explains the adjustable pipette and how it should be used in the laboratoty.
